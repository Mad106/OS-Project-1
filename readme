Conents of tar: 
Makefile - makefile for shell

bgjobs.c - implements background processes using waitpid and prints results
cd.c - implementation of cd command
echo.c - implementation of echo command

How to use makefile

The make command will compile all necessary files into an executable named shell. To run the shell,
just enter "shell". To clean up after execution, just type "make clean".


Known Bugs/Incomplete Parts
---------------------------
- Piping prints incorrect output. I'm unable to determine the cause. - Ryan
